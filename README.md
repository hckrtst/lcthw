###Valgrind
Every linux developer should be familiar with valgrind. I tend to develop bewtween Arch Linux and OS X. Apple as usual give you a bit of a runaround with the dev tools. 
[Here](http://ranf.tl/2014/11/28/valgrind-on-mac-os-x-10-10-yosemite/) is a tip I found that seems to be useful for OS X.
I love the fact that zed mentions Valgrind so [early](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex4.html) in the game in [LearnCTheHardWay](http://c.learncodethehardway.org).  

###strace
strace is one of the most useful debugging tools any linux developer can have. On Mac OS try the "dtruss" command for the same overwhelming feeling of gleefulnees.
